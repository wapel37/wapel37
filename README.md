### Hi there good people :wave:

#### About me :point_right: :point_left:
- I like Python
- I really like Python, but i like Kotlin too
- â›µ I love sailing

### EVERYTHING BELOW IS THE RELICT OF THE PAST (except discord username)
I'll try to remember to update it ;)

#### What i'm actually doing? (and why it's not in public repo... :disappointed:)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Discord Bots** ðŸ¤–
  - **About Project** This bots are made for one guild use, but are awesome. Of course there is support for slash commands.
    The code is divided for two parts: base part which is discord.py Client but better (connected to db, handles commands, but supports inheritance, etc.)
    and separate main part for each of five bots!
  - **What we have now?**
    - autoroles,
    - selfroles,
    - dynamic voice channels with bounded text ones,
    - 5 level rank system with diffrent level up requirement for each role,
    - some currency for friends (we can only make bets with each other, so it's closed circuit, and we buy something for the richest one),
    - warns system
  - **What we plan to add?**
    - music bot functionality (5 bots = 5 channels at once)
    - memes rating system with role for best memes in last month
    - more!
  - **Why not public yet?** It's a little messy code and my tokens are as plain text in it, but i'll make it avaliable for you soon.
    I have to find some place for my tokens, regenerate them and teach my friends how to use branches.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working on my own **Minecraft launcher: Fusion Launcher**
  - **Why another mc launcher?** My main purpose is to provide:
    - other thinking about configurations
    - easiest way of loading mods and loading modpacks from friends...
    There will be two main features:
    1. support for drag'n'drop of `.zip` files fith mod packs with automatic modeloader and zip structure identification without asking anything
    2. option to connect your servers with plugins (plugins for customizable gui depending of server access). Plugins planned by me:
       - standard minecraft "ping" - for any server u wand
       - rcon - for every server you have rcon access
       - ssh + docker - for your servers, with rich control panel (because im using `itzg/minecraft-server`)
       - ...later maybe something with server side mods/plugins for better control and information
  - **Why not public yet?** It's messy, i'll will change visibility to public in few commits. I have to write meaningful readme and patch some critical bugs...
    (i want it to run on linux as well as windows because some of my friends are still using it, but looking for java 8 in any system is a little bit problematic)
- ðŸ”­ (I'm planning one secret cringy game, more details soon, for now i have one word: `chuunibyou`)
- ðŸ‘¯ I even collaborate on some android app for singers, but it's also secret

#### How to reach me?
It's simple: just use discord... **wapel37**
