### Hi there good people :wave:

#### About me :point_right: :point_left:
- I like Python
- I really like Python, but i like Kotlin too
- â›µ I love sailing

#### What i'm actually doing? (and why it's not in public repo... :disappointed:)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Discord Bots** ðŸ¤–
  - It's a little messy code and my tokens are as plain text in it, but i'll make it avaliable for you soon.
    I have to find some place for my tokens, regenerate them and teach my friends how to use branches.
    This bots are made for one guild use, but are awesome. They handle autoroles, selfroles,
    dynamic voice channels with bounded text ones, 5 level rank system with diffrent level up requirement for each role,
    some currency for friends (we can only make bets with each other, so it's closed circuit, and we buy something for the richest one),
    worns system, and we plan add music functions, memes rating system with role for best memes in last month and more!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working on my own **Minecraft launcher: Fusion Launcher**
  - It's messy, i'll will change visibility to public in few commits. I have to write meaningful readme and patch some critical bugs...
    (i want it to run on linux as well as windows because some of my friends are still using it, but looking for java 8 in any system is a little bit problematic)
    The main purpose is to provide other thinking about configurations, easiest way of loading mods and loading modpacks from friends...
    The best planned feature is to support drag'n'drop of `.zip` files fith mod packs with automatic modeloader identification
    and instant avaliable play button without configuring anything! It will also provides option to connect your servers with plugins for customizable gui
    (premade launcher plugins (for connecting servers) will be: simple minecraft "ping" - for every server, rcon - for every server you have access, ssh + docker     for your servers, with rich control panel, later maybe something with mc server side mods/plugins for better control)
- ðŸ”­ (I'm planning one secret cringy game, more details soon, for now i have one word: `chuunibyou`)
- ðŸ‘¯ I even collaborate on some android app for singers, but it's also secret

#### How to reach me?
It's simple: just use discord... **wapel37#4422**
But wait! We don't have any common guilds, and i'm ignoring your friend request?
Hmm... u can use this (there are my discord bots also): https://discord.gg/u3c2mzRWKC
